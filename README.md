# ui5-lib-webide-demo

This is just a demo project to illustrate how smoothly you can implement a ui5 library and an app in the SAP Full-Stack Web IDE. All you need to do is uploading the 2 zip files into the SAP Full-Stack Web IDE, then you deploy the lib projects, finally you run the app project. Done.
